The Lean Startup & Coders Corner Meetup Group

This is a paid group that includes food and admission to the next event.
We are lean startup fanatics and coders that are doing lean startup experiments in 1 weekly scrum sprint.  We are a mini-hack-a-thon meets a leader board (based on traction – how do you value teams with a head start?)
The learn x is a series of learnings described by the lean startup principles of build measure learn
The cost for a learnx meetup is 100 kr which includes:
Pizza and drink (water, soda, beer, wine) plus
1 x Admission ticket to next learnx meetup event valued at 50kr
You can buy a month ticket which is all 4 times 
You must be a team of 3 to start an experiment.  If no consensus is made (3 or more people) then the “default project” is worked on.  The default project is voicebitz to start with – it is seeded with 10000 dkr.
After the first round then all ideas which were not chosen may go into the default projects basket.  A random project is chosen from the defaults project basket and then if someone is present to pitch that idea and can continue an experiment then they go, otherwise we choose another random one until we end up with voicebitz.
Voicebitz is a playful and creative universe for children and youth.  I want to use html5 and webrtc to build a voice storytelling platform which includes a material design community web site and web app, and a mobile app for audio and video editing software.  
Each week an experiment loop is performed.  
That starts with a Next or Not Learn round 
If an experiment team is together again the week following then their investment capital is vested.  The CEO is always named and usually is the pitcher.  This round all returning experiment teams have the chance to tell about their experiments (5 min summary).  This is their opportunity to continue or not and to pitch to get more people on board (invested)
This can be done by skype and starts at 1900 CET and lasts no more than 1 hour.  Teams whether you continue or not shall give a recap of the learnings (what went well, what went not so well, what can be improved, continue?).  If a team does not show then it is closed and the capital is moved to the yearly prize pool

pitch round –
The pitch round:  This is like Mindfire where any new ideas or retries occur – This takes maximum 1 hr.
Next is the Next or Not Learn round –
