This folder contains all the rules and regulations and terminology and whatever else needs to be employed towards the public.
Ie. the public folder on a website or what you have for a customer then you would create an instance and only include things you change or add. Note that deletes must happen from the framework folder.
framework_client1/myclientspecific.files would be here.
